# FEDD_Project_Game
Simple bridge building game created for NCSU First-year Engineering Design Day.
Created in GameMaker Studio 2

TODO (If I ever decide to flesh out this game):
Improve physics interactions so that there can be breakages between joints, etc.
Add cables
Add functionality for beams to be support but not collide with the car
Find a cleaner way to handle beam creation such as a script rather than having it run in the step function of the button objects
