# FEDD_Project_Game
Simple bridge building game created for NCSU First-year Engineering Design Day.\n
Created in GameMaker Studio 2\n\n

TODO (If I ever decide to flesh out this game):\n
Improve physics interactions so that there can be breakages between joints, etc.\n
Add cables.\n
Add functionality for beams to be support but not collide with the car.\n
Find a cleaner way to handle beam creation such as a script rather than having it run in the step function of the button objects.
